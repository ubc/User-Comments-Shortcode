User-Comments-Shortcode
=======================

Creates a shortcode for the logged in users comments

The shortcode creates a loop & grabs all the comments made by the current logged in user. 
At this stage, it just lists out all of the comments - but in the future, pagination would be ideal.

This plugin aims to create an area for a 'user profile' or 'my history' kind of place, where the current logged in user can see their comments.
To see 'current logged in user posts' (not comments), please use the [loop] shortcode.

Enjoy :-)
